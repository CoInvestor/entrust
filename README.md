Entrust is a succinct and flexible way to add Role-based Permissions to **Laravel**.

The main project is at https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust and is probably dead, judging by the big pile of old pull requests.

This fork has been created to allow us (CoInvestor) to upgrade to Laravel 6. No warranty is provided, implicit or otherwise!
